# Portfolio Development Progress

## Recent Updates (September 19, 2025)

### ✅ Code Refactoring & Optimization

#### Services Component Enhancement
- **Refactored Services.tsx**: Converted from individual service definitions to a data-driven approach
- **Implemented Array Mapping**: Services are now defined as an array of objects and rendered using the map method
- **Improved Maintainability**: Adding new services now only requires updating the array instead of duplicating JSX
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Better structure with consistent service object properties

#### Key Changes Made:
1. **Services Array Structure**:
   ```typescript
   const services = [
     {
       id: number,
       icon: IconComponent,
       title: string,
       description: string
     }
   ]
   ```

2. **Dynamic Rendering**: Using `services.map()` to generate service cards
3. **Icon Handling**: Proper component extraction with `const IconComponent = service.icon`
4. **Consistent Styling**: Maintained all existing Tailwind classes and hover effects

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Animation System
- Added comprehensive animation components in `src/animations/`
- Framer Motion integration for smooth page transitions
- Custom animation variants for consistent motion design

#### Component Organization
- Improved component structure with logical separation
- Enhanced UI components for better reusability
- Consistent export patterns across components
